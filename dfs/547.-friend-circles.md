# 547. Friend Circles

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N\*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M\[i\]\[j\] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

```text
Example 1: 
Input: [[1,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,0,1]] 
Output: 2 
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
