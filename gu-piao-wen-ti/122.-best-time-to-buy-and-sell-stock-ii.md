# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times\).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] 
Output: 7 
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. 

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

所有价格上涨日，都进行买卖

价格下降就不操作，保证不亏钱

设 tmp 为第 i-1 日买入与第 i 日卖出赚取的利润，即 tmp = prices\[i\] - prices\[i - 1\] ； 当该天利润为正 tmp &gt; 0，则将利润加入总利润 profit；当利润为 0 或为负，则直接跳过； 遍历完成后，返回总利润 profit

        }   
        int tmp = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i<n; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                tmp += prices[i] -prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return tmp;   
    }
