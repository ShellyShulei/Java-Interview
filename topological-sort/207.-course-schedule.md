# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: \[0,1\]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

```text
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] 
Output: true 
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible. Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]] 
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {

        List<List<Integer>> adjacency = new ArrayList<>();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            adjacency.add(new ArrayList<>());
        // Get the indegree and adjacency of every course.
        for(int[] cp : prerequisites) {
            indegrees[cp[0]]++;
            adjacency.get(cp[1]).add(cp[0]);
        }
        // Get all the courses with the indegree of 0.
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            if(indegrees[i] == 0) queue.add(i);
        // BFS TopSort.
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int pre = queue.poll();
            numCourses--;
            for(int cur : adjacency.get(pre))
                if(--indegrees[cur] == 0) queue.add(cur);
        }
        return numCourses == 0;
    }
}
