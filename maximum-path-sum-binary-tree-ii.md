# Maximum Path Sum Binary Tree II

Given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer number. Find the maximum possible sum **from any node to any node \(the start node and the end node can be the same\).** 

**Assumptions**

* â€‹The root of the given binary tree is not null

**Examples**

   -1

  /    \

2      11

     /    \

    6    -14

one example of paths could be -14 -&gt; 11 -&gt; -1 -&gt; 2

another example could be the node 11 itself

The maximum path sum in the above binary tree is 6 + 11 + \(-1\) + 2 = 18
