# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor I

Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor.

**Assumptions**

* There is _**no parent**_ pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
* The given two nodes _**are guaranteed**_ to be in the binary tree

**Examples**

        5

      /   \

     9     12

   /  \      \

  2    3      14

The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5

The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9

LCA\(root, a, b\) ï¼š LCA of roots in a set of \(a,b\) that are under root

Case1:  both a and b are under root, return lca\(a,b\);

Case2:  if one of a or b is under root, return a or b

Case3: if neither a nor b is under root, return null;

        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

        }
