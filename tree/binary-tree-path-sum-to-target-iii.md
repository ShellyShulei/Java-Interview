# Binary Tree Path Sum To Target III

Given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer number. Determine if there exists a path **\(the path can only be from one node to itself or to any of its descendants\),** the sum of the numbers on the path is the given target number.

```text
Examples
    5
  /    \
2      11
     /    \
    6     14
  /
 3
```

If target = 17, There exists a path 11 + 6, the sum of the path is target.

If target = 20, There exists a path 11 + 6 + 3, the sum of the path is target.

If target = 10, There does not exist any paths sum of which is target.

If target = 11, There exists a path only containing the node 11.
