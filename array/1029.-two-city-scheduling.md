# 1029. Two City Scheduling

There are `2N` people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `A` is `costs[i][0]`, and the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `B` is `costs[i][1]`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `N` people arrive in each city.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

先假设都飞去了A， 再计算出要是改成去B，要有多少钱的差异
